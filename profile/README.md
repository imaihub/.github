# Welcome to IMAIHub! 🚀  

At [**IMAI Research Community**](https://www.nhlstenden.com/en/IMAI), we are committed to advancing **computer vision and data science** through cutting-edge research.

As part of [**NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences**](https://www.nhlstenden.com/), our mission is to develop innovative AI solutions that enhance human-machine collaboration across various industries.  

Our open-source projects on GitHub provide state-of-the-art AI tools and methods for processing data from various domains such as **traffic safety, agriculture, healthcare and robotics**.

In addition to these AI tools, our projects include modular pipeline components that allow others to **accelerate research and reproduce our results**, fostering collaboration and innovation.

## 🤝 Get Involved  
We actively welcome **contributions** from researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts worldwide 🌍. Whether you have a **feature request**, a **bug report**, or want to collaborate on cutting-edge AI research, we’d love to hear from you!

## 🔬 About IMAI  

I'M A.I. (IMage Processing and Artificial Intelligence) is an initiative of [**NHLStenden**](https://www.nhlstenden.com/en/) that connects AI technology with real-world applications. Built on a strong foundation of [**Computer Vision & Data Science professorship**](https://www.nhlstenden.com/en/research/research-and-professorships/computer-vision-data-science), its mission is to **share, broaden, and deepen collective knowledge on artificial intelligence**.  

I'M A.I. operates on four key pillars:  

- **Research Community** – A hub for cutting-edge applied research where students, teachers, researchers, and companies collaborate in a design-based atelier to tackle real-world AI challenges.  
- **Learning Community** – A space for companies, students, and educators to explore AI, offering sessions from **AI 101s to deep dives** on application and technological domains.  
- **Business Community** – A network for companies to collaborate on shared AI challenges, fostering new connections and estabishing consortia.  
- **Experience Center** – A physical hub where organizations can explore AI possibilities, bring their own data, and receive expert guidance.
